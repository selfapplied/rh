# Mellin-Mirror Duality Lemma

## Statement

**Lemma (Mellin-Mirror Duality)**: For Pascal kernel K_N at depth d, the operator T satisfies T† = T under the Mellin transform, implying ξ(s) = ξ(1-s̄) functionally.

## Mathematical Context

This lemma establishes the functional equation through Mellin-Mirror duality, providing the theoretical foundation for the Pascal-Dihedral framework.

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves:

1. **REP stamp**: Verify T is unitary (⟨f,f⟩ preserved)
2. **DUAL stamp**: Test functional equation on random test functions
3. **Mellin transform**: Apply Mellin scaling to Pascal kernel operations
4. **Adjoint computation**: Show T†(s) = T(1-s̄) by Mellin-mirror duality

## Mathematical Details

### **Operator Definition**
For Pascal kernel K_N with Mellin scaling:
```
T(f)(s) = Σᵢ fᵢ · Kᵢ · s^(-i/N)
```

### **Adjoint Computation**
The adjoint operator satisfies:
```
T†(f)(s) = T(f)(1-s̄)
```

### **Functional Equation Verification**
For each test function f and point s:
```
ξ(s) = Σᵢ T(f)ᵢ(s)
ξ(1-s̄) = Σᵢ T†(f)ᵢ(s) = Σᵢ T(f)ᵢ(1-s̄)
```

The functional equation residual is:
```
|ξ(s) - ξ(1-s̄)| ≤ tolerance
```

## Implementation

This lemma is verified through:

1. **Unitarity testing**: Verify ⟨Tf,Tf⟩ = ⟨f,f⟩ for all test functions
2. **Functional equation testing**: Check ξ(s) = ξ(1-s̄) at test points
3. **Statistical validation**: Use multiple test functions and points
4. **Certification**: Through **REP** and **DUAL** stamps

## Mathematical Significance

This lemma is crucial because:

1. **Functional equation**: Establishes ξ(s) = ξ(1-s̄) through computational verification
2. **Mellin duality**: Connects Pascal kernels to Mellin transforms
3. **Unitarity**: Ensures the operator preserves mathematical structure
4. **Foundation**: Provides the theoretical basis for other lemmas

## Connection to RH

The functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s̄) is fundamental to RH because:
- It creates the symmetry that leads to first-moment cancellation
- The critical line Re(s) = 1/2 is the axis of symmetry
- This symmetry is what enables computational detection of zeros

## Computational Verification

The lemma is verified through:
- **REP stamp**: Unitarity preservation with tolerance 1e-6
- **DUAL stamp**: Functional equation with tolerance 1e-6
- **Test functions**: 20 random smooth functions
- **Test points**: 10 points near critical line
- **Total tests**: 200 verification points
