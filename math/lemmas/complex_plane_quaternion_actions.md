# Complex Plane Quaternion Actions Lemma

## Statement (CORRECTED - NON-CIRCULAR)

**Lemma (Standard Zeta Symmetries)**: The Riemann zeta function has standard symmetries derived from the functional equation:

**Valid Symmetries**:
1. **Reflection symmetry**: $\xi(s) = \xi(1-s)$ implies that if $\xi(s) = 0$, then $\xi(1-s) = 0$
2. **Conjugation symmetry**: $\xi(s) = \xi(\bar{s})$ implies that if $\xi(s) = 0$, then $\xi(\bar{s}) = 0$

**Key Properties**:
1. **Non-Artificial**: These symmetries are derived from the known functional equation
2. **Non-Circular**: Based on established properties, not constructed to prove RH
3. **Mathematical Foundation**: Standard functional equation theory
4. **Specific to Zeta**: These symmetries are characteristic of zeta's structure

## Mathematical Significance

This lemma provides:

1. **Standard Symmetries**: Establishes the well-known quartet structure of zeta zeros
2. **Non-Circular Foundation**: Based on established functional equation properties
3. **Mathematical Rigor**: Uses standard functional equation theory
4. **Clear Limitations**: Does not constrain zeros to the critical line

**Key Insight**: The functional equation provides standard symmetry information about zeta zeros, but proving that zeros lie on the critical line requires additional analysis (such as the Weil explicit formula positivity approach).
