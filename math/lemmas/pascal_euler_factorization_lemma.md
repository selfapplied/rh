# Pascal-Euler Factorization Lemma

## Statement

**Lemma (Pascal-Euler Factorization)**: For Pascal kernel K_N with prime factorization, the local factors ∏_p L_p(s) satisfy additivity:

```
log|ξ(s)| ≈ Σ_p log|L_p(s)| + O(ε_N)
```

where ε_N → 0 as N → ∞ and the approximation is uniform in compact subsets.

## Mathematical Context

This lemma establishes Euler product locality through Pascal kernel factorization, showing that the zeta function can be decomposed into local prime factors with additive logarithms.

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves three verification stamps:

1. **REP stamp**: Verify unitarity is preserved under factorization
2. **DUAL stamp**: Check functional equation holds for factor products  
3. **LOCAL stamp**: Test Euler product additivity per prime class

## Mathematical Details

### **Local Factor Computation**
For each prime p, compute local factor:
```
L_p(s) = Σᵢ fᵢ · Kᵢ · (1 + 1/p)^(-i) · p^(-s·i/N)
```

### **Euler Product**
The full Euler product is:
```
ξ(s) ≈ ∏_p L_p(s)
```

### **Additive Approximation**
The additive form is:
```
log|ξ(s)| ≈ Σ_p log|L_p(s)|
```

### **Additivity Error**
The approximation error is:
```
|log(∏L_p) - Σlog(L_p)| / |log(∏L_p)| ≤ tolerance
```

## Implementation

This lemma is verified through:

1. **Factorization unitarity**: Verify norms are preserved under prime factorization
2. **Factorization symmetry**: Check functional equation holds for factorized products
3. **Euler additivity**: Test that log(∏L_p) ≈ Σlog(L_p)
4. **Prime locality**: Verify additivity coefficient is bounded
5. **Certification**: Through **REP**, **DUAL**, and **LOCAL** stamps

## Mathematical Significance

This lemma is crucial because:

1. **Euler product**: Establishes the prime factorization structure of ξ(s)
2. **Additivity**: Shows that logarithms of local factors add up
3. **Locality**: Each prime contributes independently
4. **Foundation**: Provides the basis for local analysis of zeta zeros

## Connection to RH

The Euler product factorization is fundamental to RH because:
- It connects zeta zeros to prime distribution
- Local factors L_p(s) have their own zero structure
- The additivity property enables local analysis of zeros
- This is the foundation for understanding RH in terms of primes

## Computational Verification

The lemma is verified through:
- **REP stamp**: Factorization unitarity with tolerance 1e-4
- **DUAL stamp**: Factorization symmetry with tolerance 1e-4  
- **LOCAL stamp**: Euler additivity with tolerance 0.05
- **Test functions**: 15 Pascal-structured functions
- **Test points**: 8 points near critical line
- **Primes tested**: First 7 primes [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
- **Total tests**: 120 verification points

## Prime Contributions

The lemma tracks per-prime contributions:
- Each prime p contributes log|L_p(s)| to the total
- Prime variance measures additivity quality
- Total contribution sums over all primes
- Additivity coefficient = variance / total_contribution
