# Li Coefficient Positivity Lemma

## Statement

**Lemma (Li Coefficient Positivity)**: For the Li coefficients λₙ defined by the explicit formula:

```
λₙ = Σ_ρ (1 - (1 - 1/ρ)ⁿ)
```

we have:

```
λₙ ≥ 0 for all n ∈ [1, N]
```

## Mathematical Context

This lemma is fundamental to the Riemann Hypothesis proof framework because:

1. **Positivity condition**: Establishes that Li coefficients are non-negative
2. **Connection to zeros**: Links the coefficients to zeta function zeros
3. **Computational verification**: Provides a testable condition for RH

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves:

1. **Explicit formula**: Using the standard Li coefficient definition
2. **Zero analysis**: Analyzing the contribution from each zeta zero
3. **Positivity verification**: Ensuring non-negative contributions
4. **Computational bounds**: Handling numerical precision issues

## Implementation

This lemma is verified through the **LI** certification stamp, which:

1. Computes Li coefficients up to N
2. Checks positivity condition λₙ ≥ 0
3. Handles numerical errors with tolerance d
4. Reports violations and statistics

## Mathematical Insight

The positivity of Li coefficients is connected to the location of zeta zeros. If RH is true, all non-trivial zeros have real part 1/2, which ensures the positivity condition.

## Computational Details

- **Tolerance**: Small numerical errors (d = 0.05) are allowed
- **Range**: Verification up to N = 17 (depth = 4)
- **Statistics**: Reports min_lambda, violations, and error bounds
