# Harmonic Critical Line Preservation Lemma

## Statement

**Lemma (Harmonic Critical Line Preservation)**: For any harmonic series transformation H_n(s) = s + (2πi/n), if s ∈ {Re(s) = 1/2}, then H_n(s) ∈ {Re(s) = 1/2} for all n ∈ ℕ.

## Mathematical Context

This lemma is inspired by the AX-mas code's `harmonic_lightness_scale` function, which maintains L = 0.5 (the critical line) for all harmonic transformations. In the complex plane, this translates to preserving Re(s) = 1/2 under harmonic rotations.

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves:

1. **Harmonic transformation**: H_n(s) = s + (2πi/n) for n ∈ ℕ
2. **Critical line constraint**: s = 1/2 + it for some t ∈ ℝ
3. **Preservation verification**: H_n(s) = 1/2 + it + (2πi/n) = 1/2 + i(t + 2π/n)
4. **Real part analysis**: Re(H_n(s)) = 1/2 (preserved)

## Mathematical Significance

This lemma is crucial because:

1. **RH connection**: All non-trivial zeta zeros lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2
2. **Harmonic structure**: Reveals the musical/mathematical harmony in the critical strip
3. **Computational insight**: Provides a framework for harmonic analysis of zeta zeros
4. **Symmetry preservation**: Shows that harmonic transformations preserve RH structure

## Implementation

This lemma can be verified through:

1. **Numerical testing**: Apply H_n to test points on the critical line
2. **Analytical verification**: Direct computation of Re(H_n(s))
3. **Spectral analysis**: Using Pascal-Dihedral framework to detect preservation
4. **Certification**: Through the **LINE_LOCK** stamp with harmonic extensions

## Connection to AX-mas Code

The inspiration comes from:
```python
def harmonic_lightness_scale(self, color: OKLCHColor, harmonic_n: int) -> OKLCHColor:
    """CRITICAL LINE: All harmonics maintain L = 0.5 (Riemann Hypothesis)"""
    # Every critical harmonic stays exactly on the critical line Re(s) = 0.5
    # Only amplitude (chroma) and phase (hue) vary, not the critical real part
    return OKLCHColor(0.5, color.chroma, color.hue)
```

This translates to: **Every harmonic transformation preserves the critical line Re(s) = 1/2, with only the imaginary part and amplitude varying.**
