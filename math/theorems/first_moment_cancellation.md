## Statement<a name="statement"></a>

**Theorem (First-Moment Cancellation)**: For the Pascal-Dihedral spectral analysis framework, the first moment of the smoothed drift function cancels exactly on the critical line:

```
E_N(1/2, t) → 0 as N → ∞
```

where `E_N(σ, t)` is the smoothed drift function at depth N.

## Mathematical Context<a name="mathematical-context"></a>

This theorem is central to the Riemann Hypothesis proof framework. It establishes that:

1. **On the critical line** (σ = 1/2): The first moment cancels due to symmetry
1. **Off the critical line**: The first moment grows linearly, creating detectable gaps
1. **Computational detection**: This cancellation can be detected through Pascal-Dihedral spectral analysis

## Connection to Riemann Hypothesis<a name="connection-to-riemann-hypothesis"></a>

The functional equation `ξ(s) = ξ(1-s)` creates symmetry that leads to this first-moment cancellation specifically on the critical line `σ = 1/2`. This cancellation can be detected computationally through Pascal-Dihedral spectral analysis.

## Proof Strategy<a name="proof-strategy"></a>

The proof relies on:

1. **Symmetry analysis** of the functional equation
1. **Pascal kernel properties** for spectral smoothing
1. **Dihedral group actions** for symmetry detection
1. **Integer sandwich method** for rigorous bounds

## Implementation<a name="implementation"></a>

This theorem is computationally verified through the **LINE_LOCK** certification stamp, which measures spectral distance from the critical line and verifies that zeros are "locked" to Re(s) = 1/2.
