# Gap Scaling Law Theorem

## Statement

**Theorem (Gap Scaling Law)**: For Pascal-Dihedral spectral analysis, the integer gap scales as `gap ∝ d²` where `d = |σ - 1/2|` is the distance from the critical line, through three equivalent geometric views:

1. **Area View**: Imbalance cell area ∝ d²
2. **Solid Angle View**: Tilt angle ∝ d, solid angle ∝ d²  
3. **Second Moment View**: First moment cancels by symmetry, second moment ∝ d²

## Mathematical Context

This theorem is the foundation of the computational detection method. It explains why the Pascal-Dihedral framework can distinguish RH zeros from off-line points through integer gap analysis.

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves three geometric perspectives that all lead to the same d² scaling:

### **1. Area View (Pascal Triangle)**
- Near critical line: smoothed drift E_N(σ,t) ∝ d where d = |σ-½|
- Take Δ along three triangle axes → edges of length ∝ d
- These bound a central "imbalance cell" with area ∝ d²
- Bit gap counts lattice points in this cell → gap ∝ d²
- To maintain fixed gap: gain ∝ 1/d²

### **2. Solid Angle View (Quaternion)**
- Build rotor chain from Ω = ω_t k + ω_σ i
- Off critical line: ω_σ ∝ d tilts spin by angle θ ∝ d
- Holonomy/chirality measures solid angle Ω_s
- Small-angle law: Ω_s ∝ θ² ∝ d²
- Fix target solid angle → required gain ∝ 1/d²

### **3. Second Moment View (Kernel)**
- Pascal kernel K is even and centered → first moment = 0
- Taylor expansion at σ = ½:
  ```
  (∂_σ log|ξ| * K)(½+d,t) = 0 + ½d²(∂_σ² log|ξ| * K) + O(d³)
  ```
- First-order term cancels by symmetry
- Second-order term ∝ d² gives the contrast
- Integer sandwich converts to Hamming gap ∝ d²
- Fixed bit margin → gain ∝ 1/d²

## Mathematical Significance

This theorem is crucial because:

1. **Computational foundation**: Enables detection of RH zeros through gap analysis
2. **Scaling law**: Provides the mathematical relationship between distance and gap
3. **Three perspectives**: Shows the theorem is robust across different geometric views
4. **Symmetry principle**: First-order cancellation is fundamental to the method

## Implementation

This theorem is verified through:

1. **Geometric demonstration**: `QuantitativeGapAnalyzer.geometric_demo_d2_scaling()`
2. **Power law fitting**: Statistical verification of d² scaling
3. **Multiple perspectives**: All three views must give the same result
4. **Certification**: Through the **LINE_LOCK** stamp with gap analysis

## Connection to RH

The gap scaling law enables the connection theorem:

**If gap ∝ d² and we can detect gaps computationally, then we can detect RH zeros because:**
- On critical line (d = 0): gap = 0 (balanced)
- Off critical line (d > 0): gap > 0 (imbalanced)
- The gap provides a computational signature of RH zeros

## Mathematical Insight

The key insight is that RH-style constraints exhibit natural symmetry that breaks predictably off the critical line, creating measurable spectral signatures. The d² scaling law quantifies this breakage and enables computational detection.
