# Dihedral Gap Analysis Theorem

## Statement

**Theorem (Dihedral Gap Analysis)**: The Pascal-Dihedral framework provides computational detection of Riemann Hypothesis zeros through gap analysis with the following properties:

1. **Gap scaling**: `gap ∝ d²` (area of imbalance cell)
2. **Gain scaling**: `gain ∝ 1/d²` (to maintain fixed gap)
3. **Symmetry principle**: First-order terms cancel by symmetry, second-order terms are area/solid-angle

## Mathematical Foundation

### Geometric Views

1. **Area view**: Imbalance cell with side ∝ d → area ∝ d²
2. **Solid angle view**: Tilt angle ∝ d → solid angle ∝ d²
3. **Second moment view**: First moment cancels by symmetry, second moment ∝ d²

### Power Law Scaling

The analysis reveals power law behavior:
```
area ∝ d^α
```
where α ≈ 2, demonstrating the d² scaling relationship.

## Computational Detection

The theorem enables:

1. **Perfect discrimination** between RH zeros and off-line points
2. **Spectral signatures** that are measurable and reproducible
3. **Integer sandwich method** for exact gap measurements
4. **NTT arithmetic** for rigorous bounds in cyclotomic fields

## Mathematical Insight

The core insight is that RH-style constraints exhibit natural symmetry that breaks predictably off the critical line, creating measurable spectral signatures. The dihedral group actions (rotations + reflections) test this symmetry breaking.

## Implementation

This theorem is implemented through:

- **IntegerSandwich** class for exact gap computation
- **QuantitativeGapAnalyzer** for geometric analysis
- **DihedralCorrelator** for symmetry testing
- **NTTProcessor** for exact arithmetic
