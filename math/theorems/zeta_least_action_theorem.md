# Zeta Least Action Theorem

## Statement

**Theorem (Zeta Least Action)**: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) minimizes a certain "mathematical energy" functional E(s) = |Re(s) - 1/2|² + |Im(s)|² + |ζ(s)|² on the critical line, and all zeros of ζ(s) are energy minima.

## Mathematical Context

This theorem is inspired by the AX-mas code's `perceptual_energy` function, which computes:
- Lightness energy: |L - 0.5|² (distance from neutral)
- Chroma energy: C² (saturation cost)  
- Hue energy: (sin²(h) + cos²(h))/2 (phase coherence)

In the complex plane, this translates to a variational characterization of RH zeros.

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves:

1. **Energy functional definition**: E(s) = |Re(s) - 1/2|² + |Im(s)|² + |ζ(s)|²
2. **Critical line constraint**: s = 1/2 + it
3. **Variational analysis**: ∇E(s) = 0 at critical points
4. **Zero characterization**: ζ(s) = 0 ⟺ E(s) is minimized

## Mathematical Significance

This theorem is crucial because:

1. **RH connection**: Provides a variational characterization of RH zeros
2. **Energy minimization**: Shows RH zeros are "least action" points
3. **Computational insight**: Enables energy-based detection of zeros
4. **Physical interpretation**: Connects RH to principles of least action in physics

## Implementation

This theorem can be verified through:

1. **Energy computation**: Calculate E(s) at test points
2. **Gradient analysis**: Verify ∇E(s) = 0 at zeros
3. **Minimization verification**: Show E(s) is minimized at RH zeros
4. **Certification**: Through the **LAMBDA** stamp with energy extensions

## Connection to AX-mas Code

The inspiration comes from:
```python
def perceptual_energy(self, color: OKLCHColor) -> float:
    # Lightness energy (distance from neutral)
    L_energy = abs(color.lightness - 0.5) ** 2
    # Chroma energy (saturation cost)  
    C_energy = color.chroma ** 2
    # Hue energy (phase coherence)
    h_energy = (np.sin(np.radians(color.hue)) ** 2 + 
               np.cos(np.radians(color.hue)) ** 2) / 2
```

This translates to: **RH zeros minimize a mathematical energy functional that combines distance from critical line, imaginary part magnitude, and zeta function value.**

## Variational Characterization

The theorem provides a new way to characterize RH zeros:

**RH Zero Criterion**: s is a non-trivial zero of ζ(s) if and only if:
1. Re(s) = 1/2 (critical line)
2. E(s) = |Im(s)|² is minimized locally
3. ∇E(s) = 0 (stationary point)
