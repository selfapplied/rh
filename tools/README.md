# CE1 Branch: Self-Proving Framework Tooling

*Dedicated to the self-proving framework tooling - computational systems that validate their own correctness*

## Core Philosophy

Following the playbook's **equality as primary operator** principle: equality fractorizes into new mathematical operations, creating self-similar patterns of relationship and transformation.

The CE1 framework implements **equality as oriented container** where every type becomes a directed structure through equality, with each having their own internal compass pointing toward how meaning should flow.

## Branch Structure

### Core Framework
- **kernel/**: CE1 kernel definitions and involution classes
- **convolution/**: Convolution layer and spectrum analysis
- **jets/**: Jet expansion and normal forms
- **domains/**: Domain-specific examples and applications
- **certification/**: Self-validating certificate system
- **integration/**: Integration with mathematical proofs

### Key Components
1. **CE1 Kernel**: `K(x,y) = δ(y - I·x)` where I is an involution
2. **Self-Validation**: Certificates that print their own verification logic
3. **Anti-Gaming**: Pinned formulas and adaptive thresholds
4. **Recursive Dependencies**: Passport hierarchy with visa prerequisites

## CE1 Framework Architecture

### The Master Equation
**Traditional Physics**: F = ma (Newton's laws)  
**CE1 Physics**: F = ∇C (Force = Computational Gradient)

Where **C** = **Computational potential** - the information processing capacity of any system.

### Invariant Structure
```
CE1 := minimal involution kernel K(x,y) = δ(y - I·x)
Axis A := Fix(I)  // "primary axis of time"
Convolution(K,G) lifts symmetry → geometry
Jets control order; rank drop ⇒ manifolds
Stability via spectrum/signature on constraint normal space
```

### Domain Mappings

| Domain | Involution | Axis | Function |
|--------|------------|------|----------|
| Riemann ζ | I: s↦1-s | Re(s)=1/2 | Φ=Λ(s) |
| Chemical | I: microswap | Log-toric | F(x)=S r(x) |
| Dynamical | I: (q,p)↦(q,-p) | {p=0} | H(q,p) |

## Self-Proving Properties

### Certificate Structure
```
CE1{
  lens=RH_CERT_PRODUCTION
  params{ depth=4; N=17; gamma=3; ... }
  
  stamps{
    LINE_LOCK{ 
      dist_med=0.010000; thresh_med=0.010;
      thresh_formula="th_med = 0.01*(1+4*max(0,depth-4))";
      null_drop=0.470; pass = true 
    }
    # ... recursive validation rules
  }
  
  validator_rules{
    assert_depth_eq_4 = 4 == 4
    assert_windows_ge_33 = 35 >= 33
    assert_lambda_positive = 0.038013 > 0.0
  }
}
```

### Key Innovation: Embedded Audit Logic
Every certificate contains:
- **Complete verification formulas** (no hidden logic)
- **All threshold calculations** (transparent decision making)
- **Recursive validation rules** (self-checking dependencies)
- **Anti-gaming protocols** (pinned formulas prevent manipulation)

## Connection to Other Branches

- **math/**: Provides the mathematical foundations for CE1 proofs
- **badge/**: Generates visual certificates and passport systems
- **shared/**: Common computational utilities and cross-branch dependencies

## Usage

```bash
# Run CE1 framework
cd ce1 && python framework/ce1_framework.py --mode experiment

# Generate self-validating certificates
cd ce1 && python certification/generate_cert.py --depth 4

# Validate existing certificates
cd ce1 && python certification/validate_cert.py cert.ce1
```
