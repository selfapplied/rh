# Functional Equation Symmetry Lemma

## Statement

**Lemma (Functional Equation Symmetry)**: The completed zeta function satisfies the functional equation:

```
ξ(s) = ξ(1-s)
```

This symmetry is preserved under the Pascal-Dihedral framework.

## Mathematical Context

This lemma is crucial because:

1. **Fundamental symmetry**: The functional equation is a defining property of ξ(s)
2. **RH connection**: The symmetry is related to the critical line Re(s) = 1/2
3. **Computational verification**: Can be tested numerically

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves:

1. **Standard completion**: Using the standard ξ(s) definition
2. **Symmetry verification**: Testing ξ(s) = ξ(1-s) at test points
3. **Residual analysis**: Measuring |ξ(s) - ξ(1-s)| with tolerance
4. **Gamma smoothing**: Applying smoothing for numerical stability

## Implementation

This lemma is verified through the **DUAL** certification stamp, which:

1. Builds completed ξ(s) using standard completion
2. Measures reflection residual |ξ(s) - ξ(1-s)|
3. Applies gamma smoothing for numerical stability
4. Verifies residual is within tolerance d

## Mathematical Insight

The functional equation creates the symmetry that leads to first-moment cancellation on the critical line. This is the foundation for the entire Pascal-Dihedral approach.

## Computational Details

- **Residual measurement**: |ξ(s) - ξ(1-s)| at test points
- **Gamma smoothing**: exp(-γ|Im(s)|) for numerical stability
- **Tolerance**: Residual must be ≤ d for verification
- **Statistics**: Reports median, 95th percentile, and maximum residuals
