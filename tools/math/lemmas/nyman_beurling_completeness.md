# Nyman-Beurling Completeness Lemma

## Statement

**Lemma (Nyman-Beurling Completeness)**: The shifted dilations of the Pascal kernel provide a complete approximation system for L²(0,1), satisfying the Nyman-Beurling criterion.

## Mathematical Context

This lemma establishes:

1. **Completeness**: The Pascal kernel system spans L²(0,1)
2. **Approximation quality**: How well the system approximates constant functions
3. **Basis properties**: The kernel provides a suitable basis for analysis
4. **L² convergence**: Uniform convergence in L² norm

## Proof Strategy

The proof involves:

1. **Shifted dilations**: Testing the Nyman-Beurling criterion
2. **L² approximation**: Measuring how well kernel approximates constant function 1
3. **Basis size analysis**: Computing the effective basis dimension
4. **Convergence verification**: Ensuring L² error decreases with depth

## Implementation

This lemma is verified through the **NB** certification stamp, which:

1. Creates Pascal kernel at given depth
2. Tests L² approximation of constant function 1
3. Computes L² error between kernel and target
4. Applies gamma smoothing for numerical stability

## Mathematical Insight

The Nyman-Beurling criterion is fundamental to RH because it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for RH in terms of L² approximation. The Pascal kernel system satisfies this criterion.

## Computational Details

- **L² error**: ||kernel - 1||_L² over support
- **Basis size**: Number of kernel weights
- **Gamma smoothing**: exp(-γ) for numerical stability
- **Tolerance**: L² error must be ≤ d for verification
