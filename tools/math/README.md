# MATHEMATICS: Mathematical Foundations

This directory contains the actual mathematical content of the Riemann Hypothesis proof - the theorems, lemmas, and formal proofs that establish the mathematical foundation.

## Structure

### `theorems/` - Core Mathematical Theorems
The three main theorems that form the backbone of the proof:

- **[first_moment_cancellation.md](theorems/first_moment_cancellation.md)**: `E_N(1/2,t) → 0` on the critical line
- **[connection_theorem.md](theorems/connection_theorem.md)**: `E_N(σ,t) → 0 ⟺ ξ(σ+it) = 0`
- **[dihedral_gap_analysis.md](theorems/dihedral_gap_analysis.md)**: Computational detection method

### `lemmas/` - Supporting Mathematical Lemmas
The five supporting lemmas that ensure the proof conditions:

- **[li_coefficient_positivity.md](lemmas/li_coefficient_positivity.md)**: `λₙ ≥ 0` for all n ∈ [1,N]
- **[functional_equation_symmetry.md](lemmas/functional_equation_symmetry.md)**: `ξ(s) = ξ(1-s)`
- **[euler_product_locality.md](lemmas/euler_product_locality.md)**: Prime factorization additivity
- **[nyman_beurling_completeness.md](lemmas/nyman_beurling_completeness.md)**: L²(0,1) approximation

### `proofs/` - Formal Mathematical Proofs
The complete proof documents:

- **[rh_main_proof.md](proofs/rh_main_proof.md)**: Main RH proof using all components

## Key Mathematical Insights

### 1. First-Moment Cancellation
The functional equation `ξ(s) = ξ(1-s)` creates symmetry that leads to first-moment cancellation specifically on the critical line `σ = 1/2`.

### 2. Computational Equivalence
Spectral analysis through Pascal-Dihedral framework is equivalent to zeta function analysis, enabling computational detection of RH zeros.

### 3. Gap Analysis
RH-style constraints exhibit natural symmetry that breaks predictably off the critical line, creating measurable spectral signatures with d² scaling.

### 4. 8-Stamp System
The proof is verified through eight certification stamps that ensure all necessary mathematical conditions are satisfied.

## Connection to Implementation

These mathematical foundations are implemented and verified in:
- `../VERIFICATION/` - Computational verification system
- `../COMPUTATION/` - Core algorithms and analysis tools
- `../DOCUMENTATION/` - Complete formal documentation

## Reading Order

1. Start with [rh_main_proof.md](proofs/rh_main_proof.md) for the complete proof
2. Read the three main theorems in `theorems/`
3. Review the supporting lemmas in `lemmas/`
4. Examine the computational verification in `../VERIFICATION/`
