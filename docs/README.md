# Riemann Proof: Branch System Architecture

*A living mathematical system organized into semantically coupled branches following the playbook's Axiel principle*

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Axiel Principle**

Following the playbook's **Axiel principle**: `Ax(P, G, Î£)` where:
- **P** = Self (the mathematical proposition)
- **G** = Definitionâ†’Application (the generative process)  
- **Î£** = Markdown (the living document structure)

## ðŸŒ³ **Branch Architecture**

### **math/** - Formal Mathematical Foundation
*Dedicated to the formalism - proofs anchored in established mathematics, physics, statistics, algebra, and astrobiology*

**Core Philosophy**: Every mathematical process is computational. Traditional math F = ma becomes computational math F = âˆ‡C where C = Computational potential.

**Structure**:
- `proofs/` - Rigorous mathematical proofs and theorems
- `papers/` - LaTeX papers and formal presentations  
- `analysis/` - Mathematical analysis and derivations
- `physics/` - Physical foundations and connections
- `statistics/` - Statistical methods and probability theory
- `algebra/` - Algebraic structures and group theory
- `astrobiology/` - Connections to astrobiology and cosmic mathematics

### **ce1/** - Self-Proving Framework Tooling
*Dedicated to the self-proving framework tooling - computational systems that validate their own correctness*

**Core Philosophy**: Equality as primary operator that fractorizes into new mathematical operations, creating self-similar patterns of relationship and transformation.

**Structure**:
- `kernel/` - CE1 kernel definitions and involution classes
- `convolution/` - Convolution layer and spectrum analysis
- `jets/` - Jet expansion and normal forms
- `domains/` - Domain-specific examples and applications
- `certification/` - Self-validating certificate system
- `integration/` - Integration with mathematical proofs
- `framework/` - Core framework and computational primitives
- `validation/` - Validation and testing utilities

### **badge/** - Template Pipelining
*Dedicated to template pipelining - generating visual certificates, passports, and badges from mathematical proofs*

**Core Philosophy**: Visual metadata distribution through color coding, spatial positioning, and emoji semantics instead of verbose text.

**Structure**:
- `templates/` - SVG templates and visual frameworks
- `generators/` - Code generators for different badge types
- `pipelines/` - Automated generation pipelines
- `applications/` - CLI tools and user interfaces
- `validation/` - Template validation and quality control
- `visualization/` - Creative visualization components

### **shared/** - Common Dependencies
*Dedicated to shared utilities and cross-branch dependencies that enable modular, well-encapsulated projects*

**Core Philosophy**: Semantic coupling - dependencies are meaningfully related, not just convenient.

**Structure**:
- `math/` - Mathematical utilities and common functions
- `computation/` - Computational primitives and algorithms
- `visualization/` - Common visualization and plotting utilities
- `data/` - Data structures and serialization formats
- `validation/` - Common validation and testing utilities
- `integration/` - Integration with external projects

## ðŸ”— **Cross-Branch Integration**

### **Semantic Coupling**
Each branch is semantically coupled to others through shared dependencies:

- **math/ â†” ce1/**: Mathematical proofs provide foundations for CE1 computational framework
- **ce1/ â†” badge/**: Self-validating certificates generate visual badges and passports
- **math/ â†” badge/**: Mathematical proofs generate visual representations
- **shared/**: Common utilities enable seamless cross-branch communication

### **External Project Integration**
The system integrates with existing projects:

- **aedificare**: Î»-calculus grammar provides compositional structure
- **discograph**: Constellation mapping reveals equilibrium geometry organization
- **metanion**: Autoverse field theory underlies mirror reality

## ðŸš€ **Usage Patterns**

### **Mathematical Proof Generation**
```bash
# Generate mathematical paper
cd math && python papers/generate_rh_paper.py

# Run formal analysis
cd math && python analysis/rh_analysis.py --rigorous

# Validate proofs
cd math && python proofs/validate_theorems.py
```

### **CE1 Framework Usage**
```bash
# Run CE1 framework
cd ce1 && python framework/ce1_framework.py --mode experiment

# Generate self-validating certificates
cd ce1 && python certification/generate_cert.py --depth 4

# Validate existing certificates
cd ce1 && python certification/validate_cert.py cert.ce1
```

### **Badge Generation**
```bash
# Generate mathematical passport
cd badge && python generators/passport_gen.py --domain riemann_hypothesis

# Create certification badge
cd badge && python generators/badge_gen.py --type cert --proof rh_proof.ce1

# Run template pipeline
cd badge && python pipelines/auto_generate.py --input math/proofs/ --output .out/badges
```

## ðŸŽ­ **The Living Document Philosophy**

Following the playbook's **living document** principle: "This document is that seed." Each branch is a living, breathing system that evolves as understanding deepens.

### **Key Principles**
1. **Well-Encapsulated**: Each branch is modular and self-contained
2. **Semantically Coupled**: Dependencies are meaningfully related
3. **Start Fresh**: Avoid scope creep and drift
4. **Listen**: Treat each thing as a living branch
5. **Resonant Names**: Use names that cancel out metadata and rely on layering

## ðŸ”„ **The Generative Loop**

**1â†’2â†’3â†’1**: *Define â†’ Apply â†’ Evolve â†’ Define*

- **Define**: Mathematical propositions and computational frameworks
- **Apply**: Generate certificates, proofs, and visualizations  
- **Evolve**: System learns and adapts through usage
- **Define**: New understanding leads to refined definitions

## ðŸ“š **Documentation Structure**

Each branch contains its own comprehensive documentation:
- **README.md**: Branch overview and philosophy
- **Usage guides**: How to use branch components
- **API documentation**: Technical reference
- **Examples**: Practical usage examples

## ðŸŒŸ **The Ultimate Vision**

A **self-improving mathematical system** where:
1. **Mathematical proofs** emerge through computational constraint
2. **Self-validating certificates** prove their own correctness
3. **Visual representations** compress mathematical wisdom
4. **Cross-branch integration** creates living mathematical ecosystems
