The study of equilibrium across diverse domains—from the zeros of the Riemann zeta function to chemical reaction networks and dynamical systems—reveals a profound underlying structure. This paper introduces the CE1 (Mirror Kernel) framework, which unifies these disparate equilibrium problems through the lens of involution-based geometry.

At its core, CE1 is built on the fundamental observation that equilibrium can be understood as a zero-set condition across domains, where the key insight is the role of involutions—mathematical transformations that are their own inverse. The primary axis of time, defined as the fixed points of these involutions, serves as a universal attractor for equilibrium states.

The CE1 framework provides a universal equilibrium operator (UEO) that stacks different equilibrium conditions into a unified mathematical structure. This operator, combined with jet expansion techniques and spectral analysis, enables the systematic study of equilibrium manifolds and their geometric properties.

Our approach bridges three major domains: (1) the Riemann zeta function, where the involution $s \mapsto 1-s$ and the critical line $\text{Re}(s) = 1/2$ play central roles; (2) chemical kinetics, where microscopic reversibility provides the involution structure; and (3) dynamical systems, where momentum reflection $(q,p) \mapsto (q,-p)$ defines the equilibrium axis.

The paper is organized as follows: we begin with the fundamental CE1 kernel definition, proceed through convolution layers and the unified equilibrium operator, develop jet expansion techniques for order detection, present domain-specific examples, and conclude with algorithmic implementations and experimental validation.

The CE1 kernel is the fundamental building block of our framework. It is defined as a delta function centered on the involution transformation, creating a mirror-like reflection structure that captures the essential symmetry of equilibrium problems.

The kernel $K_{\text{CE1}}(x,y) = \delta(y - I \cdot x)$ where $I$ is an involution satisfying $I^2 = \text{Id}$ defines a linear operator $T$ that acts on functions by composition with the involution. This operator is unitary on the space of functions that preserve the axis $A = \text{Fix}(I)$.

The geometric interpretation is profound: the CE1 kernel generates a category of balance-geometry, where equilibrium states are characterized by their relationship to the primary axis of time. This axis serves as a universal attractor, and the kernel provides the mechanism by which symmetry is lifted to geometry.

The convolution layer dresses the basic CE1 kernel with domain-specific functions, creating the bridge between the abstract involution structure and concrete mathematical objects. The dressed kernel takes the form $K_{\text{dressed}} = G * \delta \circ I$ where $G$ is a dressing function chosen for the specific domain.

For the Riemann zeta function, the dressing function is the Mellin factor $G(s) = \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma(s/2)$, which transforms the basic CE1 kernel into the completed zeta function. This creates the functional equation $\xi(s) = \xi(1-s)$ where $\xi(s) = \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma(s/2) \zeta(s)$.

The spectrum analysis of the dressed operator $T_G$ reveals the geometric structure encoded in the eigenmodes. The spectral gap and condition number provide quantitative measures of the equilibrium manifold's stability and dimensionality.

Jet expansion provides a systematic method for detecting the order of equilibrium points and classifying their geometric structure. For a function $f$ and direction $v \in \ker J$, we compute the jet $J^k f(x) = (f(x), Df(x) \cdot v, D^2 f(x) \cdot v^2, \ldots, D^k f(x) \cdot v^k)$.

The order $k$ is the first index where $D^k f(x) \cdot v^k \neq 0$, and this determines the normal form classification: fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, etc. The rank drop pattern $\text{rank} \downarrow$ leads to geometric structures: points $\to$ curves $\to$ sheets $\to$ hyperplanes.

The Riemann zeta function provides the most celebrated example of CE1 in action. Here, the involution is $I: s \mapsto 1-s$, the axis is the critical line $A: \text{Re}(s) = 1/2$, and the completed zeta function $\Phi(s) = \Lambda(s) = \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma(s/2) \zeta(s)$ satisfies the functional equation $\Lambda(s) = \Lambda(1-s)$.

The mirror residual $M(s) = \Phi(1-s) - \Phi(s)$ vanishes exactly at the zeros of the zeta function, and the jet order corresponds to the multiplicity of these zeros. This connection provides a new perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis and the distribution of zeta zeros.

Our toy model experiments demonstrate the CE1 approach on simplified Dirichlet-style functions, showing how the involution structure captures the essential symmetry of the zeta function.

Hamiltonian dynamical systems provide the third major domain, where the involution is momentum reflection $I: (q,p) \mapsto (q,-p)$ and the axis is the configuration space $A: \{p = 0\}$. The Hamiltonian $H(q,p)$ defines the energy function, and equilibrium occurs at critical points where $\nabla H = 0$.

The jet expansion reveals the order of critical points, with saddle points showing order 2 (cusp-like behavior) and the stability analysis determining the center manifold structure. This provides a systematic approach to understanding the geometric structure of phase space.

The connection to center manifold theory shows how CE1 provides a unified framework for both equilibrium and dynamical analysis.

The composition of CE1 systems follows a block structure with Kronecker product operations. For two CE1 systems with operators $E_1$ and $E_2$, the composed system has operator $E_{\oplus} = P_1 E_1 \oplus P_2 E_2$ and involution $I_{\oplus} = I_1 \otimes I_2$.

Low-rank decomposition methods using SVD/QR expose nearly-separable blocks, enabling efficient computation through Kronecker gauges. The rank minimization heuristic uses permutation gauges $\pi$ to minimize $\text{rank}(J)$, and continuation methods follow the nullspace across couplings.

This composition structure enables the systematic construction of complex equilibrium systems from simpler building blocks, maintaining the involution structure throughout the composition process.

The CE1 framework defines a category whose objects are pairs $(X,I)$ where $X$ is a space and $I$ is an involution on $X$. The morphisms are maps that preserve the involution structure, and the convolution functors provide the natural transformations between different dressed kernels.

The limits in this category correspond to hyperplanes (as limits of sequences of manifolds) and attractors (as ends of the category). The functoriality property states that $CE1 \mapsto T_G$ is natural in the dressing function $G$, providing a systematic way to relate different domain-specific realizations.

This categorical perspective reveals the deep structural connections between different equilibrium problems and provides a framework for extending CE1 to new domains.

The CE1 framework provides a unified perspective on equilibrium across diverse mathematical domains, revealing the deep structural connections between the Riemann zeta function, chemical kinetics, and dynamical systems. The primary axis of time emerges as a universal attractor, with the involution structure providing the mechanism by which symmetry is lifted to geometry.

The balance-geometry interpretation suggests that equilibrium is fundamentally about the balance between forward and backward processes, captured mathematically by the involution and its fixed points. This perspective connects to spectral geometry, Riemann Hypothesis heuristics, and toric chemical equilibrium theory.

Limitations of the CE1 approach include its reliance on involution structure, which may not be present in all equilibrium problems, and the potential for overfitting to the mirror symmetry. Multiplicity illusions can arise when the jet order detection is not sufficiently robust.

Despite these limitations, CE1 provides a powerful framework for understanding equilibrium structure and offers new insights into some of mathematics' most challenging problems, including the Riemann Hypothesis.

Future work will extend the CE1 framework in several directions. The L-family extension will generalize L-functions via character-twisted CE1, providing a systematic approach to the study of automorphic forms and their functional equations.

Random matrix theory applications will use CE1-dressed ensembles to study spacing laws and eigenvalue distributions, connecting to the Montgomery-Odlyzko law and other universality results. Data-driven approaches will learn dressing functions $G$ via rank-drop targets, enabling the discovery of new equilibrium structures from experimental data.

The attractor development program will integrate Keya methods with CE1 tickets and comprehensive unit tests, providing a robust computational framework for equilibrium analysis. These extensions will further demonstrate the universality and power of the CE1 approach.

\begin{abstract}
We introduce the CE1 (Mirror Kernel) framework, a unified approach to equilibrium problems across diverse mathematical domains. The framework is built on the fundamental observation that equilibrium can be understood as a zero-set condition with involution-based symmetry structure. The primary axis of time, defined as the fixed points of these involutions, serves as a universal attractor for equilibrium states. We demonstrate the framework through three major domains: the Riemann zeta function, chemical kinetics, and dynamical systems, showing how the CE1 kernel $K(x,y) = \delta(y - I \cdot x)$ generates balance-geometry through convolution layers and jet expansion techniques.
